                    <p>
                        To add new commands to a Root Around Command Box, either select the "+" tab that is located in the top row of tabs, or
                        click on the "Add New Command" button that is located on the top right side of the screen. Once on the "Add New Command" 
                        page, select a platform and a topic under which the new command should be stored. The topic can be an existing topic 
                        of your choice, or select "Add New Topic" and provide a name for a new topic. Then provide a description of the new command,
                        the command itself, and any notes you wish to include about it. Finally, click "Save" and you will be automatically 
                        navigated to your new command in your Command Box which will be immediately visible and ready for use.

                        multiple copies of identical commands under the same platform and topic, you will be unable to save the command if the command already exists with the same command description and notes.

                        Copying commands is useful when the same command can be used in multiple platforms and you would therefore like to store the
                        command in each platform. Copying commands is also useful when you want to store the same command under different topics 
                        for faster command lookup.

                    <p>
                        To make a copy of an existing command in a Root Around Command Box, right click anywhere in the Command area of an existing command and select "Edit command."
                        Once on the "Edit Command" page, you can edit either the platform and/or topic under which the command will be copied to. 
                        The topic can be an existing topic of your choice or a new topic. To store the command under a new topic, select "Add New Topic" and provide a name for the new topic. 
                        You can also edit the command description, the command itself, and/or any notes about the command that you wish to add or change. 
                        Once the changes have been made, click "Copy" and you will be automatically navigated to the copied command in your Command Box. The original
                        command will not be changed or removed, only a copy will have been made with the changes you have provided.

                        then click "Save." You will then be automatically navigated to the new topic in your Command Box.

                        a new topic name. If the topic already exists, you will be alerted and no new topic will be created; your Command
                        Box will remain unchanged.

                        Provide a new name for the topic and click "OK." The new name can start with the same letter as the original topic or start with a different letter.
                        The topic will be updated immediately and placed in the correct tab and alphabetical order.
                    </p>

                        <strong>NOTE: </strong>A topic with zero commands is unable to be renamed. 
                        Attempting to rename a topic with zero commands will result in the tab being deleted.
                        To rename a topic that has zero commands, please delete the topic and then add a new topic with the desired name 
                        on the "Add New Command" or "Edit Command" page. Then provide a command to be stored in the topic.

                        In addition, you will be unable to rename the topic with a name that already exists, so be sure to provide
                        a new topic name. If the topic already exists, you will be alerted and the topic will not be renamed; your Command

                        To add a new platform in a Root Around Command Box, select "Add New Platform" in the Platform drop-down menu at the 
                        top of the screen. Provide the platform name and click "OK." The new platform will be immediately visible in the drop-down
                        list. Select it to be navigated to it. There will initially be zero commands in the platform, but you are immediately able
                        to start adding new commands to it via the "Add New Command" page or by importing a dumpfile of commands for that platform.

                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> If importing a dump file of commands for the new platform, you can skip this step of creating the new
                        platform. Running a platform import will automatically create the new platform if it does not
                        already exist.

                        Reordering the platforms in a Root Around Command Box changes the order in which they are listed in the Platform drop-down menu.
                        This is useful if you desire to place the platforms you use more frequently near the top of the list, or to group similar platforms
                        together for quicker lookup. The platform that is first in the list is the platform upon which Root Around opens; those commands are
                        seen first.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>To reorder the platforms, use the "Customize Platforms" tool located in the Tools menu at the top of the screen. Use the up and down
                        arrows on the right side of the screen to place the "Selected" platforms in the desired order. Click "Save" and the changes will be immediately
                        visible.

                        Use the left and right arrows in the middle of the screen to move the undesired platform(s) from the "Selected" list to
                        the "Available" list. Click "Save" and the "Available" platforms will no longer be visible in the
                        Command Box.

                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> The "Available" platforms are not visible in the Command Box but can be re-added at any time. 
                        They are still available to include. Just

                    <p>
                        Full exports ensure that commands are never lost and are always available. Running a Full export will create a single
                        .sql dump file that when imported into a Root Around Command Box, instructs Root Around how to create an identical Command
                        Box to the one that was exported. All of the current platforms, commands, and customizations will be copied into the
                        file. This allows you to move your Command Box from one computer to another, or to recover
                        it in the event of hardware failure or another mishap.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <strong> Note:</strong> To be able to restore your Command Box after hardware failure, make sure to store the dump
                        file created from the Full export in a separate location from your Command Box. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To run a Full export, navigate to the File menu on the top left side of the screen and select "Export..." Choose the
                        "Full" export type and click "OK." Finally, choose a directory to store the .sql Dump file. Providing a file name is
                        not necessary, but if preferred, provide a file name that uses the .sql file extension, such as "Full_Export.sql."
                        When ready, click "Export." A Dump file will be immediately created containing instructions for Root Around on how
                        to recreate your entire current Command Box. If the Command Box needs to be moved to another computer or recovered
                        after a mishap, import this Dump file into Root Around, and your current Command Box will be automatically recreated.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <i> Note: Your Command Box will be unaffected by an export. Exports

                    <p> 
                        It is recommended to run a Full export before importing any dump file to be able to recover your current Command Box
                        and undo any unwanted changes that occurred during the import.

                        Importing a dump file that was created from a Full export provides the ability to move your Command Box from one 
                        computer to another, or to recover it in the event of hardware failure or another mishap. The import will
                        automatically recreate the entire Command Box that was exported, including all of the platforms, commands, and 
                        customizations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Importing a dump file from a Full export will overwrite the entire existing Command Box. Only import this
                        type of dump file if you are moving your Command Box to a different computer or all of your existing commands
                        are already present in the dump file and you only need to recover commands that were lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To import a dump file that was created from a Full export, navigate to the File menu on the top left side of the screen and select
                        "Import..." Locate the dump file you wish to import and click "Import." If you are sure that you want to import the
                        dump file, click "Yes." The Command Box will then be automatically rebuilt to be identical to the Command Box that was
                        exported. It may take a few minutes to complete the import and rebuild. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is recommended to run a Full export before importing any dump file to be able to recover your current Command Box
                        and undo any unwanted changes that occurred during the import.

                    <p>
                        Importing a dump file that was created from a Platform export provides the ability for Root Around users to easily share
                        platforms with each other. This type of sharing works best when the platform does not yet exist in your Command Box but
                        you would like to add it with the commands from your peer's Root Around Command Box. Importing the dump file will
                        automatically create the new platform for you and also add all of the commands and notes that were stored in that
                        platform. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the platform already exists in your Command Box, importing a dump file from a Platform export 
                        will overwrite all of the commands that currently exist in the platform. If you do not want to lose your existing commands
                        in the platform but still want to add the commands from your peer, 
                        import a dump file created from a "Currently Selected Commands" export instead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To import a dump file that was created from a Platform export, navigate to the File menu on the top left side of the screen and select
                        "Import..." Locate the dump file you wish to import and click "Import." If you are sure that you want to import the
                        dump file, click "Yes" and then provide a name for the new platform. Your new platform and commands will then be added and be immediately ready for use.
